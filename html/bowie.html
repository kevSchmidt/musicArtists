        <p class="biography-text">
          David Robert Jones (8 January 1947 – 10 January 2016), known
          professionally as David Bowie , was an English singer-songwriter and
          actor. He was a leading figure in the music industry and is considered
          one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, acclaimed
          by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during
          the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual
          presentation, with his music and stagecraft having a significant
          impact on popular music. During his lifetime, his record sales,
          estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the
          world's best-selling music artists. <br />
          Born in Brixton, Bowie developed an interest in music as a child,
          eventually studying art, music and design before embarking on a
          professional career as a musician in 1963. "Space Oddity" became his
          first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart after its release in July
          1969. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during
          the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy
          Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of his single
          "Starman" and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the
          Spiders from Mars, which won him widespread popularity. In 1975,
          Bowie's style shifted radically towards a sound he characterised as
          "plastic soul", initially alienating many of his UK devotees but
          garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one
          single "Fame" and the album Young Americans. <br />
          After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had UK number
          ones with the 1980 single "Ashes to Ashes", its parent album Scary
          Monsters, and "Under Pressure", a 1981 collaboration with Queen. He
          reached his commercial peak in 1983 with Let's Dance; the album's
          title track topped both UK and US charts. Throughout the 1990s and
          2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including
          industrial and jungle. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long
          recording hiatus with The Next Day. He remained musically active until
          he died of liver cancer at his home in New York City, two days after
          his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, Blackstar
          (2016).

          “I always had a repulsive need to be something more than human. I felt
          very puny as a human. I thought, 'Fuck that. I want to be a
          superhuman.”

        <p class="inspiration-text">
          Bowie studied art, music, and design, including layout and
          typesetting. He received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his
          friend George Underwood punched him in the left eye during a fight
          over a girl. After a series of operations during a four-month
          hospitalisation, his doctors determined that the damage could not be
          fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty depth perception and a
          permanently dilated pupil, which gave a false impression of a change
          in the iris's colour; the eye later became one of Bowie's most
          recognisable features. <br />
          Bowie met Angela Barnett in April 1969. They married within a year.
          Her impact on him was immediate, and her involvement in his career
          far-reaching, leaving manager Ken Pitt with limited influence which he
          found frustrating. Having established himself as a solo artist with
          "Space Oddity", Bowie began to sense a lacking: "a full-time band for
          gigs and recording—people he could relate to personally". Bowie's
          observation of two seminal American proto-punk artists led him to
          develop a concept that eventually found form in the Ziggy Stardust
          character: a melding of the persona of Iggy Pop with the music of Lou
          Reed, producing "the ultimate pop idol". <br />
          Bowie's love of acting led his total immersion in the characters he
          created for his music. "Offstage I'm a robot. Onstage I achieve
          emotion. It's probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being
          David." With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting
          the same role over an extended period, it became impossible for him to
          separate Ziggy Stardust—and later, the Thin White Duke—from his own
          character offstage. Ziggy, Bowie said, "wouldn't leave me alone for
          years. That was when it all started to go sour ... My whole
          personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have
          doubts about my sanity." His later Ziggy shows, which included songs
          from both Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane, were ultra-theatrical
          affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping
          down to a sumo wrestling loincloth or simulating oral sex with
          Ronson's guitar.

          David Robert Jones was born in Brixton on January 8, 1947. At age 13,
          inspired by the jazz of the London West End, he picked up the
          saxophone and called up Ronnie Ross for lessons. Early bands he played
          with – The Kon-Rads, The King Bees, the Mannish Boys and the Lower
          Third –provided him with an introduction into the showy worlds of pop
          and mod, and by 1966 he was David Bowie, with long hair and
          aspirations of stardom rustling about his head. Kenneth Pitt signed on
          as his manager, and his career began with a handful of mostly
          forgotten singles and a head full of ideas. It was not until 1969 that
          the splash onto the charts would begin, with the legendary Space
          Oddity. <br />
          Amidst his musical wanderings in the late '60s, the young Bowie
          experimented with mixed media, cinema, mime, Tibetan Buddhism, acting
          and love. A first rock album, originally titled David Bowie then
          subsequently re-titled Man of Words, Man of Music and again as Space
          Oddity, paid homage to the kaleidoscopic influences of the London
          artistic scene, while hinting at a songwriting talent that was about
          to yield some of rock n roll's finest and most distinctive work--even
          if it would take the rest of the world a few years to catch up.

          The lyrics describe Ziggy Stardust bringing a message of hope to
          Earth's youth through the radio, salvation by an alien 'Starman'. The
          story is told from the point of view of one of the youths who hears
          Ziggy. According to Bowie himself, Ziggy Stardust is not the Starman
          but merely his earthly messenger. <br />
          The song has inspired interpretations ranging from an allusion to the
          Second Coming of Christ, to an accurate prediction of the plot for the
          film Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977).
