        <p class="biography-text">
          Stephanie Lynn Nicks (born May 26, 1948) is an American singer and
          songwriter. Nicks is best known for her work as a songwriter and
          vocalist with Fleetwood Mac, and her chart-topping solo career. She is
          known for her distinctive voice, mystical stage persona and poetic,
          symbolic lyrics. <br />
          Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac in 1975 along with her then- boyfriend,
          Lindsey Buckingham. Fleetwood Mac's second album after the
          incorporation of Nicks and Buckingham, was the best-selling album of
          the year of its release. In 1981, while remaining a member of
          Fleetwood Mac, Nicks began her solo career, releasing the studio album
          Bella Donna. She has been known for her multiple wardrobe changes
          during live performances, almost having a new outfit for each song she
          sang. Nicks sings about the store where her iconic style all started
          in the song "Gypsy" . In the song, Nicks sings of a store called the
          Velvet Underground, a boutique in San Francisco, California where
          famous rockers like Janis Joplin and Grace Slick were known to shop.
          It was at the Velvet Underground where Nicks' unique and easily
          recognizable style began.
          <br />
          Nicks is the only woman to have been inducted twice into the Rock and
          Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of Fleetwood Mac in 1998 and as a solo
          artist in 2019.

          Nicks has said that her vocal style and performance antics evolved
          from female singers like Grace Slick and Janis Joplin. She admitted
          inspiration when she saw Joplin perform live (and opened for her with
          her first band Fritz) shortly before Joplin's death. Nicks owns a
          strand of Joplin's stage beads. She also commented that she once saw a
          woman in her audience dressed in dripping chiffon with a Gibson Girl
          hairstyle and big boots, and Nicks knew she wanted something similar.
          She took the look and made it her own. Over the years, she has
          decorated her microphone stand with roses, ribbons, chiffon, crystal
          beads, scarves, and small stuffed toys. <br />
          In late 2004, Nicks began visiting Army and Navy medical centers in
          Washington, D.C. While visiting wounded service men and women, she
          became determined to find an object she could leave with the soldiers.
          She eventually decided to purchase hundreds of iPod Nanos, load them
          with music, artists, and playlists which she would hand select, and
          autograph them: I call it a soldiers' iPod. It has all the crazy stuff
          that I listen to, and my collections I've been making since the 1970s
          for going on the road, when I'm sick ... or the couple of times in my
          life that I have really been down, music is what always dances me out
          of bed.

        <p class="theBand-text">
          Fleetwood Mac are a British-American rock band, formed in London in
          1967. They have sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making
          them one of the world's best-selling bands. In 1998, select members of
          Fleetwood Mac were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and
          received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. <br />
          Fleetwood Mac was founded by guitarist Peter Green, drummer Mick
          Fleetwood and guitarist Jeremy Spencer. Bassist John McVie completed
          the lineup for their self-titled debut album. Danny Kirwan joined as a
          third guitarist in 1968. Keyboardist Christine Perfect, who
          contributed as a session musician from the second album, married McVie
          and joined in 1970. At this time it was primarily a British blues
          band, scoring a UK number one with "Albatross", and also had other
          hits such as the singles "Oh Well" and "Man of the World". All three
          guitarists left in succession during the early 1970s, to be replaced
          by guitarists Bob Welch and Bob Weston and vocalist Dave Walker. By
          1974, all three had either departed or been dismissed, leaving the
          band without a male lead vocalist or guitarist. <br />
          In late 1974, while Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he
          was introduced to folk-rock duo Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks.
          Fleetwood Mac soon asked Buckingham to be their new lead guitarist,
          and Buckingham agreed on condition that Nicks would also join the
          band. The addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more pop
          rock sound.

          Nicks discovered the Rhiannon character in the early 1970s through a
          novel about a woman named Branwen who is possessed by another woman
          named Rhiannon. After writing the song, Nicks learned that Rhiannon
          originated from a Welsh goddess, and was amazed that the haunting song
          lyrics applied to the Welsh Rhiannon as well. <br />
          Live performances of the song were sometimes prefaced with Nicks
          saying, "This song's about an old Welsh witch." The song built to a
          climax in which Nicks' vocals were so impassioned that, as drummer and
          band co-founder Mick Fleetwood recalled, "her Rhiannon in those days
          was like an exorcism."
