        <p class="biography-text">
          James Douglas Morrison (December 8, 1943 – July 3, 1971) was an
          American singer, songwriter and poet, who served as the lead vocalist
          of the rock band the Doors. Due to his poetic lyrics, distinctive
          baritone voice, wild personality, unpredictable and erratic
          performances, and the dramatic circumstances surrounding his life and
          early death, Morrison is regarded by music critics and fans as one of
          the most iconic and influential frontmen in rock history. Since his
          death, his fame has endured as one of popular culture's most
          rebellious and oft-displayed icons, representing the generation gap
          and youth counterculture. <br />
          Together with Ray Manzarek, Morrison co-founded the Doors during the
          summer of 1965 in Venice, California. The band spent two years in
          obscurity until shooting to prominence with their number-one single in
          the United States, "Light My Fire," taken from their self-titled debut
          album. Morrison wrote or co-wrote many of the Doors' songs, including
          "Light My Fire", "Break On Through (To the Other Side)", "The End",
          "Moonlight Drive", "People Are Strange", "Hello, I Love You",
          "Roadhouse Blues", "L.A. Woman", and "Riders on the Storm". He
          recorded a total of six studio albums with the Doors, all of which
          sold well and received critical acclaim. Though the Doors recorded two
          more albums after Morrison died, his death severely affected the
          band's fortunes, and they split up in 1973. <br />
          Morrison was also well known for improvising spoken word poetry
          passages while the band played live. He died unexpectedly at the age
          of 27 in Paris. As no autopsy was performed, the cause of Morrison's
          death remains unknown.

          “People are afraid of themselves, of their own reality; their feelings

          Love hurts. Feelings are disturbing. People are taught that pain is
          evil and dangerous. How can they deal with love if they’re afraid to

          A voracious reader from an early age, Morrison was particularly
          inspired by the writings of several philosophers and poets. He was
          influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche, whose views on aesthetics,
          morality, and the Apollonian and Dionysian duality would appear in his
          conversation, poetry and songs. Some of his formative influences were
          Plutarch's Parallel Lives and the works of the French Symbolist poet
          Arthur Rimbaud, whose style would later influence the form of
          Morrison's short prose poems. He was also influenced by Celine,
          Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Charles Baudelaire, Molière, Franz Kafka,
          Albert Camus, Honoré de Balzac, along with most of the French
          existentialist philosophers. <br />
          His senior year English teacher said, "Jim read as much and probably
          more than any student in class, but everything he read was so offbeat
          I had another teacher check to see if the books Jim was reporting on
          actually existed. I suspected he was making them up, as they were
          English books on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century demonology. I'd
          never heard of them, but they existed, and I'm convinced from the
          paper he wrote that he read them, and the Library of Congress would've
          been the only source."

          The Doors were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965,
          with vocalist Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby
          Krieger, and drummer John Densmore. They were among the most
          controversial and influential rock acts of the 1960s, mostly because
          of Morrison's lyrics and his erratic stage persona, and the group was
          widely regarded as representative of the era's counterculture. By 1972
          the Doors had sold over 4 million albums domestically and nearly 8
          million singles. The Doors were the first American band to accumulate
          eight consecutive gold LPs. According to the RIAA, they have sold 33
          million records in the US and over 100 million records worldwide,
          making them one of the best-selling bands of all time.

          Critic Lindsay Planer comments that Morrison's lyrics "reveal a
          literacy that had rarely been incorporated into rock music": "Break on
          Through" is structured like a love song. However, Morrison’s
          phraseology cleverly juxtaposes romantic lyrics such as "I found an
          island in your arms/A country in your eyes" with the almost sinister
          lines "arms that chain/Eyes that lie". <br />
          This song is about breaking through the "doors of perception"- what
          you see and think to be real, and what really is real- to the "other
          side", the side of life and everything you've never seen before. This
          means different things to different people.
