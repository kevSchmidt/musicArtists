        <p class="biography-text">
          Kurt Donald Cobain (February 20, 1967 – April 5, 1994) was an American
          singer, songwriter, and musician, best known as the guitarist and
          leader of the rock band Nirvana. Regarded as a Generation X icon, he
          is considered to be one of the most iconic and influential rock
          musicians in the history.
          <br />
          Born in Aberdeen, Washington, Cobain formed the band Nirvana with
          Krist Novoselic and Aaron Burckhard in 1987 and established it as part
          of the Seattle music scene which later became known as grunge. After
          signing with major label DGC Records, Nirvana found global success
          with "Smells Like Teen Spirit" from their critically acclaimed second
          album Nevermind (1991). Following the success of Nevermind, Nirvana
          was labelled "the flagship band" of Generation X, and Cobain was
          hailed as "the spokesman of a generation"; however, Cobain resented
          this, believing his message and artistic vision had been
          misinterpreted by the public, with his personal problems often subject
          to media attention.
          <br />
          During the last years of his life, Cobain struggled with heroin
          addiction and chronic health problems such as depression. He also
          struggled with the personal and professional pressures of fame, and
          his marriage to musician Courtney Love. On April 8, 1994, Cobain was
          found dead at his home in Seattle at the age of 27; police concluded
          he had died on April 5 from a self-inflicted shotgun wound to his
          head.

          Cobain originally wanted Nevermind to be divided into two sides: a Boy
          side, for the songs written about the experiences of his early life
          and childhood, and a Girl side, for the songs written about his
          dysfunctional relationship with his girlfriend. In the four months
          following their break-up, Kurt would write a half dozen of his most
          memorable songs. Cobain said in an interview with Musician that "some
          of my very personal experiences, like breaking up with girlfriends and
          having bad relationships, feeling that death void that the person in
          the song is feeling. Very lonely, sick". <br />
          While Cobain regarded In Utero "for the most part very impersonal", on
          the album he dealt with his parents' divorce, his newfound fame and
          the public image and perception of himself and Courtney Love on "Serve
          the Servants," with his enamored relationship with Love conveyed
          through lyrical themes of pregnancy and the female anatomy on
          "Heart-Shaped Box." Cobain wrote "Rape Me" as an objective discussion
          of rape. He wrote about fame, drug addiction and abortion on
          "Pennyroyal Tea", as well as women's rights and the life of
          Seattle-born Farmer on "Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on
          Seattle." <br />
          Cobain was affected enough to write the song "Polly" from Nevermind,
          after reading a newspaper story of an incident in 1987, where a
          14-year-old girl was kidnapped after attending a punk rock show then
          raped and tortured with a blowtorch. She managed to escape after
          gaining the trust of her captor Gerald Friend through flirting with
          him. <br />
          Patrick Süskind's novel Perfume: The Story of a Murderer inspired
          Cobain to write the song "Scentless Apprentice" from In Utero. The
          book is a historical horror novel about a perfumer's apprentice born
          with no body odor of his own but with a highly developed sense of
          smell, and who attempts to create the "ultimate perfume" by killing
          virginal women and taking their scent.

          Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington in
          1987. It was founded by lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and
          bassist Krist Novoselic. Nirvana went through a succession of
          drummers, the longest-lasting and best-known being Dave Grohl, who
          joined in 1990. Though the band dissolved in 1994 after the death of
          Cobain, their music maintains a popular following and continues to
          influence modern rock and roll culture. <br />
          In the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle
          grunge scene, releasing its first album, Bleach, for the independent
          record label Sub Pop in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on
          dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy
          choruses. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts,
          often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. During their
          three years as a mainstream act, Nirvana was awarded an American Music
          Award, Brit Award, Grammy Award, seven MTV Video Music Awards and two
          NME Awards. They have sold over 25 million records in the United
          States and over 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the
          best-selling bands of all time.

          Dating back to 1988, "About a Girl" was reportedly written after
          Cobain spent an afternoon repeatedly listening to "Meet the Beatles!".
          Cobain didn't have a title for the song when he first brought it into
          the studio. When asked what it was about, he replied, "It's about a
          girl." <br />
          The "girl" was Tracy Marander, Cobain's then-girlfriend, with whom he
          lived at the time. She asked Cobain why he had never written a song
          for her, and he replied with this song. Cobain never told Marander
          that he had written "About a Girl" for her.
